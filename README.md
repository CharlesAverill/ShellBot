# Shell bot

Discord bot that runs shell commands. Works on any channel that starts with tty or pty. You need the "Shell" role to send commands, and the "President" role to be sudo. It also automatically downloads any files sent. Its kinda jank, but it works. This is potentially a dangerous bot btw, and should only be used with people you trust. Putting it in a docker container should probably make it safe though. Put your bot key in a file called secrets.py in a string called token
